<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Xatkit-SPL Backend provides an API for chatbot modeling through different technologies. The main goal is to improve the utility of chatbots making them more accesible to the public with our automatic chatbot builder tool.

Intended workflow explained:
* User logs-in the website, creating a new user.
* Navigates to the configurator, and start defining a product-line-based chatbot family in an easy and understandable way + providing some basic information.
* Once the user has finished the modelling, hit enter and you will be prompted to create the chatbots you need.
* Define the name, the description and the intent information for this new chatbot product.
* Now, your chatbot is being tested with [FLAMA](https://github.com/diverso-lab/core), which is an automated tool for feature model analysis.
* Once everything is ready, the chatbot gets created through [Xatkit](https://github.com/joszamama/xatkit-main), compiles all the necesary packages and gets automatically deployed in the localhost through Docker.

There are a few known bugs that we acknowledge, described in the projects section. If you detect any other new bug, please consider reporting it!
